# Chess Game

Welcome to my repository for the implementation of the project, **Chess Game**. For the initial iteration of this project, I will utilize C++. 

## Description

### Project Objectives

- Understand the rules of chess. 
  - Piece movement
  - Special moves (castling, en passant, pawn promotion)
  - Conditions for end of game
- Implement basic chess logic in C++
  - Creation of classes for pieces, board
  - Movement logic for each piece
- Create a user interface
- Add advanced features 

### Project Milestones

- Planning
  - Project (goals, resources, requirements)
  - Product (objectives, tasks, dependencies, data flow)
- Design pieces
  - Class `Piece`
- Implement the board
  - 2 dimensional array
- Implement the game loop
  - Accept input from users
  - Calls functions for movement of pieces
  - Redraws board
- Testing
- Implement advanced features
- Final testing and debugging
- Completion
