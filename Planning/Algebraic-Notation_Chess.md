## Getting Oriented

### Anatomy of the Board
- Top = letters (white)
- Bottom = numbers (black)

### Set Up

- Black = bottom (numbers)
- White = top (letters)

## Describing Moves

There are two different ways in which players tend to describe the movements of their pieces in a chess game. 
- Algebraic Notation
- Descriptive Notation

### Algebraic Notation

- Each square of the chessboard is assigned a letter and a number:
	- Letters ranging from A to H (left to right)
	- Numbers ranging from 1 to 8 (bottom to top)

#### Describing a Move
